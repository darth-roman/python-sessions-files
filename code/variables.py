# What are variables
    # Containers with names that holds data in memory
    # Imagine them as boxes used to hold specific value
    # How to use them?

# chaima = "Health IT and not healthit"
# print(chaima)

# family_name = "Chouchane"
# second_name = "Salah"

# name = "Radja11"
# print(name)


'''
    # Rules
        # They should not start with a NUMBER or contain a special character (#, @, !)
        # using underscores is allowed => first_name = "Chouchane", at any positionm start, middle or end
        # They should have a meaning when declared

    # Common Mistakes:
        # naming a var and using a diffrent name
        # Naming a var with a random name and get mixed with readability and confusions

# message = "This is a simple message"
