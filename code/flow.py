# Examples
# age = 18
# if False:
#     print("Congrats, you are legally and adult")
# else:
#     print("You are still a baby")

# # in statement (List)
# students = ["Louai", "Maria", "Marie", "Meriem", "Aya"]
# print("Sara" in students)

# Practice

##### Loops #####
## They are used to repeat a routine for a specific amount of repeats or until a condition is 
## either True or False

## For loops

# for i in range(10):
#     print(f"Hello {i}")


students = ["Louai", "Maria", "Marie", "Meriem", "Aya"]
# for i in students:
#     if i == "Louai":
#         print("Male")
#     else:
#         print("Female")

first_student = students[0]

# i = len(students)-1
# while first_student != students[i]:
#     print(students[i])
#     i-=1

# age = 5
# while age <= 18:
#     print("You are an adult")
#     age += 1
